        answer: "A Home Buyer Advocate is fundamentally different from a traditional agent. At Agent Mira, your interests come before anything elseâ€”even our own. Unlike traditional brokers who represent both buyers and sellers, we work exclusively for buyers, ensuring there is zero conflict of interestâ€”not just with the seller, but also with the agent's own financial incentives. <br><br> Traditional agents often earn higher commissions when buyers spend more or when they push deals through quickly. With Agent Mira's flat-fee model, our success isn't tied to the price of your homeâ€”we succeed only when you succeed. That means every piece of advice we give is based on what's best for you, not what benefits the agent or brokerage. <br><br> Our mission is to be your ultimate advocateâ€”providing unbiased guidance, AI-powered insights, and expert negotiation strategies to secure the best possible home for you. With Agent Mira, you're never pressured into a deal that isn't in your best interest. Instead, we empower you with data, transparency, and true advocacy so that you can buy your home with total confidence."
